# Main problem Statement
The main problem statement of our project is to do the sentimental analysis of covid 19 tweets in India.We then build a visualization dashboard which is helpful in understanding the results visually.  
Our approach to this problem comprises of three modules namely <br>
--->live sentimental analysis,<br> 
--->past tweet analysis and<br>
--->Chatbot 


# 1.Live Sentimental analysis
First the live tweets page is the place where the tweets that are posted online currently regarding covid 19 will be  displayed . In addition the corresponding score is also displayed. There are other two tabs in which one potrays the image vise analysis of the tweet which when clicked on it takes us to original location of the tweet that's the twitter. In the other tab the overall setimental score will be displayed through the analysis. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>"Analyse live tweets from the twitter with hashtags "#IndiaFightsCorona", "#covid19Karnataka" , "#ICMRFIGHTSCOVID19", "#CoronaWarriors","#TogetherAgainstCovid19" and drawing meaningful graph,Locating tweets source on Indian map, Perform image analysis on Images tagged for tweets using power of Watson visual recognition."</i>

<br>

# 2.Past tweet analysis
The second module is the past data analysis where the data sets are analysed and their corresponding word frequency count, the sentimental graph will be displayed. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>"Analyse the past tweets from India right from the beginning of lockdown till june end and performing sentimental analysis and plotting beautiful bar graphs , word clouds etc.,. (Lock down 1.0,Lockdown 2.0 …….. ) Now, here for our current scope we only analysed tweets on April 16."</i>
<br>

# 3.Chatbot
The third module is the chatbot. The main purpose of the chat bot is to create a interactive environment between the user and the server. The chatbot is trained to answer the question related to the corona virus such as sanitizers, symptoms ,masks etc. It is also trained to explain the features that are included in this project. 
<br>

# Additional features

--->In additon we created a <b> awareness page</b> inorder to spread awareness to the people using it.Basic awareness such as <b> wash hands and wear masks </b>are shown.And a demo video of the same is attached at the end.<br>
--->We also Provide an external link to <b>Location wise tweet analysis of India </b> by IIT Tirupathi , which is a value added feature. We have also mentioned about the same in our idea, which we found after a long search from internet.It has all the features we expected to include. It shows the <b>Overall tweets count and Five basic emotions of people
(Happy,Sad,Surprise,Anger,Disgust) along with Neutral emotion </b> for the given range of days. Right from <b>march and upto june </b> the analysis is present. What we have done is <b>we provide a platform </b> where you can totally understand about the sentiments of people in India through our website.

# Future Scope

--->Future scope of this project would be <b>processing of more past tweets</b> and add the <b>analysis of the tweets in each day</b>. <br>
--->To <b>increase the accuracy of the chatbot</b> in terms of counts. 
--->And also create a <b>predictive model</b> in which the sentiments of the people would be predicted if any other lockdown impostions are made in future
