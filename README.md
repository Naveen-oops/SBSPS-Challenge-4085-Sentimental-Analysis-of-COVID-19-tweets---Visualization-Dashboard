# Main problem Statement
The main problem statement of our project is the creation of visualisation dashboard to do the sentimental analysis of covid tweets in India. 
Our approach to this problem comprises of three modules namely 
--->the live data analysis,<br> 
--->secondly the past data analysis and<br>
--->the last is the chatbot 


# Live Sentimental analysis
First the live tweets page is the place where the tweets that are posted online currently regarding covid 19 will be  dispalayed . In addition the corresponding score is also displayed. There are other two tabs in which one potrays the image vise analysis of the tweet which when clicked on it takes us to original location of the tweet that's the twitter. In the other tab the overall setimental score will be displayed through the analysis. 
<br>

# Past tweet analysis
The second module is the past data analysis where the data sets are analysed and their corresponding word frequency count, the sentimental graph will be displayed. 
<br>

# Chatbot
The third module is the chatbot. The main purpose of the chat bot is to create a interactive environment between the user and the server. The chatbot is trained to answer the question related to the corona virus such as sanitizers, symptoms ,masks etc. It is also trained to explain the features that are included in this project. 
<br>

In additon we created a awareness page inorder to spread awareness to the people using it.
Future scope of this project would be processing of the more datasets of past tweets and add the analysis of the tweets in each day. To increase the accuracy of the chatbot in terms of counts. And also create a predictive model in which the sentiments of the people would be predicted if any other lockdown impostions are made in future
